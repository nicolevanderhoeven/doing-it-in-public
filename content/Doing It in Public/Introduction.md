*Doing WHAT in public?*

We often treat learning something the way we treat sex.

We hesitate to acknowledge we're doing it, for fear of judgment or ridicule. If we must do it, we do it behind closed doors, and even as we enjoy it, we do so with the appropriate amount of guilt. We delight in it in secret until one day, perhaps nine months from now, we have something to show for it: a product of our efforts. This, finally, is a thing we can be publicly proud of, even as we downplay the process of getting there.

The truth is that everyone else is doing it too.

It's difficult to admit we have a lot to learn, especially when we need to learn things we feel we ought to know already. No matter how much experience we have, or how often we've made something, it's still difficult to silence the nagging voice in our heads that wonders how we got as far as we did without knowing much of anything. We don't want to be found out, so we transgress in the dark and play catch-up and make our mistakes where nobody else will see them. At the end of it, if we chance upon the creation of something halfway decent, *then* we let other people see it. This, in our minds, is what it looks like to be an expert maker of stuff: a showcase of beautiful things made from "nothing". Because we're just that good.

But there's another way to make things without the angst, one that is kinder to ourselves than we sometimes forget to be. It's a way that enables us to learn and think and play and question and make mistakes without feeling like we're stupid. It's a philosophy of learning that is forgiving while moving fast enough to be fun:
