*Doing WHAT in public?*

We often treat learning something the way we treat sex.

We hesitate to acknowledge we're doing it, for fear of judgment or ridicule. If we must do it, we do it behind closed doors, and even as we enjoy it, we do so with the appropriate amount of guilt. We delight in it in secret until one day, perhaps nine months from now, we have something to show for it: a product of our efforts. This, finally, is a thing we can be publicly proud of, even as we downplay the process of getting there.

The truth is that everyone else is doing it in secret too.

We do it in secret because it's difficult to admit we have a lot to learn, especially when we need to learn things we feel we ought to know already. No matter how much experience we have, or how often we've made something, it's still difficult to silence the nagging voice in our heads that wonders how we got as far as we did without knowing much of anything. We don't want to be found out, so we transgress in the dark and play catch-up and make our mistakes where nobody else will see them. At the end of it, *if* we chance upon the creation of something halfway decent, *then* we let other people see it. This, in our minds, is what it looks like to be an expert: having a showcase of beautiful things effortlessly made from nothing. Because we're just that good.

But there's another way to make things without the pretense, one that is kinder to ourselves than we can be. It's a way that enables us to learn and think and question and *play*, just for the joy of it. It's a philosophy of learning that is forgiving while moving fast enough to be fun:

*Doing it in public.*

## What is learning in public?

Learning in public is a fundamental subversion of how most of us learn to learn. Instead of waiting until the end to show off the resulting work, learning in public shows the process of creating it. Instead of polish and perfection, the public learner aims for authenticity and progress. And instead of downplaying the effort it took to make something, they openly acknowledge the struggle and doubt that are constant companions of making anything worth making.

Learning in public is about showing your work [^kleon] as part of the creation process, using social networks and digital tools to shorten the gap between ideation and production. Public learners post questions on social media when someone says something they don't understand, but want to learn. Their status updates are a progress report of their latest project. They speak up during community spaces to pitch ideas. They turn on the camera and press record without scripting what they're going to say. They publish blog posts before they feel ready. They apply to speak at conferences before they feel they're experts. Public learners make mistakes loudly, waiting for someone to correct them. And they're genuinely happy when someone does.

Learning in public is like working with the garage door up [^matuschak] and leaving it open as an invitation: an invitation for others not just to watch them work, but to participate in the process as co-creators to a community of knowledge.


## Why should you learn in public?


Public learners jump wholeheartedly into new topics, unfettered by the pressure to be perfect.
